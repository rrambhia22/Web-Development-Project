# Web-Development-Project

This is a small scale project for Online Book Buying. 
Here, the process of ordering books in a book bank by the student is automated. 
The student has to first register into the system with the following details: Name, Password, DOB, College, Dept, Semester, Email, Phone number. 
On registration, the student will get a new unique user for library purposes. Using the name and password, the student can log into the system. 
In the student profile page, all the details of the students are displayed. 
From this page, the student can navigate to the request books page, where he/she can select the books that he needs. 
Once he/she chooses the books and submits the request, the system will reserve the book and generate him/her an automated bill regarding the book chosen, 
it's price, and the date of issue.
